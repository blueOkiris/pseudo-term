# Pseudo-Term

## Description

A simple game engine for ASCII art games.

Pseudo term is a library that provides a consistent terminal size and style, along with a system of game objects and rooms.

Define your game objects using the `GameObject` trait, organize them into rooms, add the rooms and global game objects to an environment and then run it.
